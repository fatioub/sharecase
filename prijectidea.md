Project Goal: To create a user-friendly, visually appealing, and efficient unit conversion application for iOS and Android (if applicable). The design should feel modern, clean, and intuitive, making unit conversion quick and effortless.
Target Audience: Users who need to quickly and accurately convert various units in their daily life, work, or travel. They appreciate clean design and ease of use.
Core Features:
Unit Category Listing: A screen displaying different categories of units available for conversion.
Specific Unit Conversion Screen: A screen dedicated to converting within a specific unit type (e.g., Temperature, Length, Currency).
Currency Conversion with Live Data: A dedicated screen for converting between currencies, utilizing live exchange rates.
Dark Mode Support: Full support for a dark mode theme.
Design Principles & Desired Look and Feel:
Modern & Clean: Minimalist design with thoughtful use of white space.
Intuitive & Easy to Use: The interface should be self-explanatory.
Visually Appealing: Use a curated color palette, typography, and iconography.
Consistent: Maintain a consistent design language across all screens.
Focus on Readability: Ensure text is easy to read in both light and dark modes.
Premium Feel: Subtle animations, polished icons, and attention to detail.
Key Design Elements and Specific Requirements:
Color Palette:
Define a primary accent color (e.g., #007AFF for a standard iOS blue, but choose your own unique color).
Define secondary colors (optional, but can add depth).
Define background colors for both light and dark modes (e.g., #FFFFFF and #121212 as starting points, but experiment with subtle shades).
Define text colors for primary, secondary, and disabled states in both light and dark modes.
Typography:
Choose a primary sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Poppins, Montserrat, or a system font with specific styling).
Define font sizes and weights for:
Screen Titles (e.g., "Units", "Currency")
Unit Category Titles (e.g., "MONETARY UNITS")
List Item Titles (e.g., "Currency", "Weight")
Input/Output Values
Labels (e.g., "From", "To")
Supplementary Information (e.g., data source)
Iconography:
Source or design a consistent set of icons for each unit type (Currency, Speed, Weight, Length, etc.).
Icons should be easily recognizable and match the app's overall style (e.g., outline, filled, line icons).
Icons should work well in both light and dark modes.
Layout & Spacing:
Define consistent padding for screen edges (e.g., 16pt, 20pt).
Define vertical and horizontal spacing between different elements (e.g., space between list items, space below titles).
Use adequate white space to prevent the interface from feeling cluttered.
Specific Screen Requirements:
Units List Screen:
The main screen users see upon opening.
Display unit categories clearly.
Each unit type within a category should be a tappable list item.
Each list item should include: an icon, the unit name, and a chevron indicating it's tappable.
Implement a visually integrated search bar at the top.
Consider subtle separators or card-like designs for list items.
Specific Unit Conversion Screen (General Example):
Screen title should clearly indicate the unit type (e.g., "Temperature").
Clear input field for the "From" value.
Clear output field displaying the converted "To" value.
Mechanisms (e.g., pickers, lists) to select the specific units to convert between (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit).
The result should update in real-time as the user types.
Currency Conversion Screen (Detailed Requirements):
Screen title: "Currency".
Clear "From" and "To" sections.
Design a visually appealing way to select the "From" and "To" currencies (e.g., tappable blocks that reveal a list or picker).
Display the selected currency code (e.g., "USD") and the full name (e.g., "US Dollar").
Input field for the value to convert.
Output field displaying the converted value.
Visually indicate the conversion direction (e.g., an arrow).
Display the data source (e.g., "Source: European Central Bank") and potentially the last update time in a smaller, less prominent font.
Design the custom numerical keyboard with a style consistent with the app (color, shape, typography of keys).
Interactions & Animations (Optional but Recommended):
Smooth transitions between screens.
Subtle animations on element taps or state changes.
Real-time update of the conversion result as the user types.
Deliverables:
High-fidelity UI screens for the key screens (Units List, Currency Conversion, and at least one other example like Temperature or Length).
Designs for both light and dark modes.
Specifications for colors (hex codes), typography (font names, sizes, weights), and spacing.
(Optional) Basic prototype showing key interactions.
Instructions for AI/Designer:
"Please create a modern and visually appealing UI/UX design for a unit converter app based on the provided documentation. Focus on creating a clean, intuitive interface with attention to detail in typography, color, and iconography. Design for both light and dark modes and provide specifications for key design elements. Use the existing screenshots as a functional base, but significantly improve the aesthetic and user experience."
